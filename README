roomstore - an irc journaller using cassandra

to run, use

java -jar roomstore.jar:cassandra-clientutil.jar:cassandra-thrift.jar:commons-cli.jar:libthrift.jar:pircbot.jar:slf4j-api.jar -nick your_nick -irc_server irc.freenode.net -channels ubuntu cassandra -cassandra_server localhost/9160


you may need to add cassandra.jar to the classpath. This is a problem with the packaging of cassandra-clientutil.jar and hopefully will be resolved shortly.


roomstore is Apache2 licensed.
